When reading Lisa Nakamura's, Digitizing Race. What I received from it was Nakamura's contextualizing the effects race has on the media. Nakamura states "studies of digital visual culture have
yet to discuss networking, social spaces, or power relations in terms of race, ethnicity, and gender, but have done a superb job at parsing the history of digitalityâ€™s address to the eye." This means that the research on race being used accurately and intentionally becomes overshadowed by the visual component of race media. This could be a reason why the mental structure of media doesn't do a job of being inclusive leaving people to not visualize themselves in what they consume.

When thinking about an app that participates in this behavior, Instagram comes to mind. Instagram has a specific tactic for what it decides to show you. When thinking about race, sometimes they do a poor job of showing people of all ethnic backgrounds. If not a different type of race than a certain look that receives the most attention on social media.
